# Weather App

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli).

It is a responsive web application that shows the weather of some city.

The city can be searched, selected from the list and bookmarked.

In addition, there is an option to switch between dark and light themes.

### Main libraries and techniques:

- [Bootstrap 4](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/getting-started/introduction/) and [Font Awesome Web Application icons](https://fontawesome.com/) for design and for displaying weather condition icons
- [RxJs](https://angular.io/guide/rx-library) to get and manage data
- [NgRx](https://ngrx.io/) for state management of the app
- [Angular Autocomplete](https://www.npmjs.com/package/angular-ng-autocomplete) to show and select the cities from AccuWeather API 
- [AccuWeather API](https://developer.accuweather.com/) to get current weather condition and 5 day's forecast by location
